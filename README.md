A simple way to version my dotfiles and other dev configurations from desktop to desktop. 

I used this guide to set everything up **=>** https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

Run the following command on a new machine after cloning this bare repository:

```
config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```
